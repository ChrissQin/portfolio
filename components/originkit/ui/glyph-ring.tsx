/**
 * Glyph Ring — characters set around concentric rings, each turning its own way.
 *
 * The grid is polar rather than square: a pixel is placed by how far out it
 * sits and how far round. The number of slots in a ring falls out of that ring's
 * own circumference divided by the pitch, which works out as a count that
 * depends on nothing but the ring index — so a character near the middle is
 * about as wide as one at the rim, for free. A fixed slot count is the obvious
 * version and it fails badly, crushing the inner rings into slivers while the
 * outer ones stretch into gaps.
 *
 * The pitch of a ring is the height of a character plus the gap after it, and
 * the panel owns those two separately. That is what makes Gap do what it says.
 * An earlier version fixed the pitch and let Gap eat into it, so opening the gap
 * only shrank the type and the rings stayed exactly where they were — the gap
 * you could see never moved. Because the pitch is built up rather than divided
 * out, the disc grows as rings, characters or gaps are added, and Size scales
 * the whole assembly rather than bounding it.
 *
 * Every ring turns at its own seeded rate and alternate rings turn the other
 * way, which is what keeps the disc from reading as one rigid plate. The
 * pointer sweeps a beam of light round with it and lights the ring it is
 * standing on, so the disc answers both parts of where the cursor is.
 *
 * Glyphs are four pixels across and six down, packed into the twenty-four bits
 * a highp float carries exactly. Twenty-five would round the top row away on
 * some drivers and every character would silently lose its lid.
 */

/*
 * How fast the disc chases the cursor, per second — what five on the old slider
 * meant. The beam has to lag a little or it reads as painted on the pointer
 * rather than as light thrown across a surface.
